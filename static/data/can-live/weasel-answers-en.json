                "written": "Put users first, make services simpler to use In the early 2000s, the government got 'on the internet'. The intention was to modernize government services, but the follow-through largely resulted in the digitalization of processes that already existed (the form is online in PDF format, you may print it). The world has changed and so have people's expectations. It is time to re-imagine government and our services to meet these high standards.\nDigital provides us with wonderful opportunities to get closer to citizen-users. We can design services with that are convenient, easy to understand and simple to use. For those of us inside government, it is easy to forget that we are not the user. We need to make our services more accessible, understandable and efficient. The recently released Government of Canada digital standards point the way and show how we can make this happen.\nWe have no more excuses. The government is taking big steps towards building technology, techniques and skills that will allow us to meet user needs.\nFind different ways of working for better results\nThe work methods that we usually associate with digital (experimentation, agile, open) provide better results for users. They are also more effective in the use of public funds. They also shed a new light on how we can work: collaboratively, in multidisciplinary teams, open, engaged and authentic.\nDigital is a state of mind: we need to ask different and new questions and find solutions to problems, and involve people with different perspectives. Digital is not only for our IT teams, it's also for teams in charge of policies, legislation, operations and support services.\nYou also told us we need to focus on better using our data, use and support open source projects and ensure government data is open data.\nWe loved hearing your responses and seeing the energy and passion you put into your work. This government has taken a huge leap forwards in the recent years and you are all a part of this. There is a lot of work still to do.\nThe Digital Academy is happy to be here as a partner and support as you continue to chart new courses for government and Canada. Let us know how we can help."

However, it is not simply the development of old jobs that make digital skills so important in the modern workplace, but the creation of entirely new jobs. There is a genuine fear of a digital skills gap created by the boom in the digital economy versus the amount of people who are trained to work in it. Specifically, the UK needs 750,000 more people with digital skills to capitalize on jobs that could boost the UK economy by 12 billion pounds.\nThe digital skills gap should not be something to be afraid of. Rather, it is an opportunity for people of all ages â not just young people â to jump into a new sector or to get a better job in their current one. Half of all British IT teachers donât have a post-A-level qualification that is relevant to IT, and so schools are eager for teachers who have any kind of degree related to computing. Being a person with digital skills, in the current economic climate, has never been more lucrative.\nMoreover, attaining these digital skills has never been easier. School coding clubs and professional training companies are happy to fill the gap left by the public sector in terms of digital skills, but there are also ways in which a person can develop their digital skills individually. There are programs and services you can use to make sure that you make the most out of your computer. Having a computer desktop that you can navigate quickly and efficiently is fast becoming more important than having a tidy desk."
